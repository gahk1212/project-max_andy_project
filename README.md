# Currency Exchanger

Max Chang & Andy Kim 

Team name - Max & Andy

We will implement a python file into java to calculate currency exchange rates from user input. 

We chose this project because we are interested in global economy and we thought it will be interesting to implement currency exchanging system into java. 

Max will work on the python, Andy will work on the calculation, and we will both work on the java and the UI. (Subject to change)

Currencies: USD, EUR, CNY, KRW (Subject to Change)
